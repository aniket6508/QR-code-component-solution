## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid




### What I learned

The major learnings while working through this project was to implement the learning of CSS i learned . Through this i also learned how to use the CSS flexbox and media queries to make the website responsive. I also learned how to use the CSS variables to make the website more dynamic and code readable . 

Some code that I'm proud of (just a part of fun):

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I will try to focus to make more dynamic and responsive website in the future. I will also try to make the website more interactive and user friendly. I will also try to make the website more accessible to the user.
